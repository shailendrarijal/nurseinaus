title: Transition from being an international student to a registered nurse in Australia
description: "This is the shortest story of my nursing journey in Australia. I started my nursing studies back in 2016. There were loads and loads of lectures, assignments, role plays, placements, and tests. After completing all those, the door to nursing registration opened for me and I got my registration back in 2020."

During my studies, I always fancied working in a hospital. Even during my studies, I was working as an assistant nurse in both aged care and hospital. I was always inclined more toward the hospital setting. However, when I applied for registered nursing jobs, I discovered that as an international student, it is difficult to get a job at a hospital because I didn't have an Australian Permanent residency or Australian citizenship.

I gave up looking for jobs in the hospital and started looking for any nursing job that I could get. Bam! Covid struck. I found a job as a telehealth nurse. The official title of the job was, 'Coronovirus hotline officer'. As the initial terror of covid slowed down, I got laid off as well. My real struggling journey started from there as I was scouring through nursing jobs on job searching platforms and applying for as many as I could. I was a fresh graduate and the dilemma of 'you-need-experience-to-get-a-job-but-you-need-a-job-to-get-experience' struck me hard. Trust me, it didn't matter that I was working as an assistant nurse because what I realised is unless you have equivalent experience, it doesn't matter.

In the process of job hunting, I got an offer from one of the regional aged care homes. I took the offer without thinking as I was desperate to get a job as a registered nurse. The place was nearly 9 hours away from the place I was living but desperate times called for it and I moved there.

I never had any interest in working as an aged care nurse. Part of it was because of the idea that I had that aged care nurses aren't that skilled and all they do is paperwork. Of course, I firsthand debunked this myth and realised how hard it truly is to be an aged care nurse. When I went to my job on the first day, I had very little knowledge about what I had to do and what the roles of aged care nurses are.

Looking after 50 residents a day, dealing with families, following up with appointments, constantly being hit by short-staffed while handling all normal work like medications, insulins, s8, attending to wounds, being in charge for the place, and then you are the only person who would be responsible for looking after those who have falls and deterioration, following up with doctors, pharmacist, pathology, radiology, patient transport, and the list goes on. With all this, you had to ensure you make sure everything is done properly with everyone's scope of practice, making sure everyone gets a proper break even if you miss one.

That is when I realized, yes it's lots and lots of paperwork, loads of them. However, I learned time management, how to resolve conflicts, handle things in a professional way, manage everyone and so much more.

Okay, this much for today. For the rest of the transition to being a successful aged care nurse in a short period of time, check out my next blog. See you there!
